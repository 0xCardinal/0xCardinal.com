In an era where up to 80% of your code can come from third parties, the security of your software supply chain is more critical than ever. Software isn't built in silos anymore. It's built on a complex web of dependencies, with each component sourced from different providers across the globe. This opens up a myriad of vulnerabilities, making your software supply chain a prime target for cybercriminals.

Welcome to our two-day intensive course on Software Supply Chain Security. This is not just another IT security course. It's a journey that takes you beyond the confines of your own code, diving into the interconnected world of software development and delivery

### Day 1 

From the Attacker's Perspective - Understanding Software Supply Chain Attacks
The journey begins by exploring the reality of today's software supply chains, where the bulk of your code is sourced externally. We will dissect real-world attacks on software supply chains, understand how they unfolded, and examine their impacts.

Through hands-on exercises, you'll step into the shoes of attackers, exploiting common vulnerabilities from developer environments and code repositories to dependencies and build/release tools. By the end of day one, you'll fully comprehend how exposed your software supply chain could be in this interconnected digital world

### Day 2
From Vulnerability to Fortification - Securing Your Software Supply Chain
On the second day, we shift gears from understanding vulnerabilities to implementing robust defenses. We delve into industry standard frameworks such as SLSA and NIST SSDF, translating them into practical strategies for each component of your supply chain

You'll get your hands dirty by applying these strategies to secure your developer environments, code repositories, and CI/CD pipelines. You will learn how to use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to manage package/dependency vulnerabilities effectively. By the end of the course, you'll be equipped to transform your software supply chain from a security liability to an asset.

In modern, fast-moving organizations, keeping pace with digital transformation initiatives without compromising security is a growing conundrum. This course caters to everyone in the IT industry, from developers and engineers to IT managers, security analysts, and CTOs

The nature of software development has changed; it’s high time our approach to securing it evolves too. This course offers not just knowledge, but practical skills to secure your software supply chain amidst this paradigm shift. It’s no longer enough to secure your code. You need to secure your software’s lifeline - the supply chain.

### Course Content (ToC):
- Day One: Understanding and Attacking Software Supply Chains
    - Introduction to Software Supply Chain
    - Supply chain beyond code dependencies
    - Attacking Development Environments
    - Attacking Code Repositories
    - Attacking Dependencies and Package Management
    - Attacking CICD Pipeline
    - Attacking Container and Virtualization Environments
    - Mapping the attacks to MITRE ATT&CK
- Day Two: Defending Software Supply Chains
    - Introduction to Defense Strategies: SLSA and NIST SSDF
    - Securing Development Environments
    - Securing Code Repositories
    - Secure Package Management and Dependency Security
    - Secure CICD Pipeline
    - Secure Container and Virtualization Environments


### Pre-requisite:
Basic knowledge of software development and IT security concepts is assumed. Familiarity with cloud platforms and CICD processes would be beneficial but not mandatory. Participants Requirements

- A laptop with a modern web browser and stable internet connection
- We will prefer keeping the scenarios cloud based however for some scenarios local system would be best so we would recommend
    - 80 GB Free Disk Space
    - Minimum 16 GB Ram (8gb max would be used by VM's)
    - Capability to run Virtual Machine via VirtualBox or VMWare
    - X86 64 bit machines
    - M1 or M2 machines can run software’s but there is no guarantee everything will work as expected.
- We will need to make accounts on services like GitHub/bitbucket/AWS etc for practical hands-on experience those accounts will be created as part of the program itself (Instructions will be provided prior to the class so students can come prepared).

### Who should attend:
Anyone involved in the IT industry would benefit from this course, including:

- Software Developers and Engineers
- IT Managers
- Security Analysts
- DevOps Practitioners
- CTOs and Decision Makers in IT

### What to expect:
- Comprehensive understanding of software supply chain vulnerabilities and defenses
- Hands-on experience with real-world scenarios and exercises
- Expert guidance on implementing security measures across different components of software supply chain
- Knowledge of industry-standard security frameworks such as SLSA and NIST SSDF

### What not to expect:
- In-depthcoding or programming lessons
- Detailed walkthroughs of proprietary or niche tools
- A focus on theoretical knowledge without practical application
- An instant fix to all your organization's software supply chain security issues. Security is an ongoing process and this course equips you with the knowledge and skills to start and continue that journey.
