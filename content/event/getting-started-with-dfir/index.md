Digital Forensics & Incident Response is a field of Information Security that focuses on the identification, acquisition, processing, analyzing and reporting of electronically stored data. Because of the growing number of endpoints and the general escalation of cybersecurity attacks, DFIR has emerged as a critical capability within an organization's security strategy and threat hunting capabilities.

Digital forensics provides the information and evidence required by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to respond to a security incident. Digital Forensics may include lots of different sections, but in this webinar, we will cover the basics of DFIR and understand how one can get started in the domain.

We will be covering -
- Essentials of DFIR
- Different Data Sources
- Chain of Custody
- Browser Forensics
- Metadata Forensics
- Challenges in the field of DFIR
- Resources to keep learning
