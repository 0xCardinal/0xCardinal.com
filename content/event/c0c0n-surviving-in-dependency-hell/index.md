In the realm of software development, the prevalence of external dependencies has given rise to a complex and challenging phenomenon known as "Dependency Hell." This talk aims to present an in-depth exploration of Dependency Hell, its tangible impact on the software supply chain, and practical solutions for effectively managing it.

During the presentation, we will first examine the intricate nature of software supply chains and the inherent risks associated with unmanaged dependencies. Through real-world examples, we will highlight the alarming consequences that can arise from neglecting this critical aspect of development. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of why Dependency Hell is a genuine concern that requires immediate attention.

This talk aims to shed light on the reality of Dependency Hell and explore practical strategies for surviving and managing it effectively. We will emphasise the need for a security-first mindset and discuss techniques such as dependency vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and secure coding practices. By implementing these measures, organisations can safeguard their software supply chain, ensuring that dependencies do not compromise application security.

Additionally, we will address the challenges of managing dependencies within the context of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Attendees will learn about practical strategies such as dependency versioning, build automation, and artifact management, enabling them to maintain both security and agility throughout the development process.

By the end of the presentation, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of the risks and challenges associated with Dependency Hell. They will also be equipped with actionable insights and best practices to effectively manage dependencies, strengthen their software supply chain's security, and streamline their CI/CD pipelines. Join us as we navigate the complexities of Dependency Hell and discover the key deliverables that empower organizations to survive and thrive in the face of this daunting challenge.
