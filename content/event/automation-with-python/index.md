summary: Talk on Automation using Python
abstract: "This talk was a three part session/workshop - where the attendees were taken from ground up with Python and are able to perform some intermediate level stuff to automate their life.

I along with my two other co-speakers, demonstrated different python scripts about making bulk certificates, organizing files to directories based on the extensions of the files, Google search any keyword from the clipboard, etc.

At the end of the talk, the participants left with working models of their own version of different automation scripts, mindset on how to automate and few resources and references to keep the learning on.

It was attended by over 200 students and working professionals."
